            <p><strong>Movie Recommendation Chatbot (February-March 2020)</strong></p>
            <p>Implemented sentiment extraction and item-item collaborative filtering in Python in order
                to construct a fully-functional chatbot that could provide movie recommendations based on
                a user's previous preferences, in addition to responding to emotions and carrying on basic 
                conversation. The chatbot could also perform spellcheck, correct for ambiguous response, and
                fail gracefully if provided with nonsensical/irrelevant content. </p>
            <p><strong>A Comparative Analysis of Hate Speech on Social Media Platforms (October-December 2019)</strong></p>
            <p> In order to identify extremists increasingly using social networks to broadcast hate speech and 
                advertize violence, I used three models to analyze three datasets from Twitter, Reddit, and a white 
                supremacist platform and perform one-versus-the-rest multiclass classification after pre-processing with 
                Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). After training and testing our models, I
                also compared the types of hate speech prevalent on each site using unsupervised clustering. Through feature 
                analysis and comparitive analysis, I ultimately identified defining features of hate speech detectors, sources of 
                bias, and methodology useful for flagging possibly dangerous accounts. </p>
            <p><strong>Multilingual Reseller Model Expansion (June-September 2019)</strong></p>
            <p> Training data for the Google Ads Integrity reseller model is dominated by English examples; 
                in order to improve our performance in Russian, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Polish, and Turkish (languages 
                belonging to countries with sensitive laws and limitations), I designed a more effecient preprocessing method 
                for the training data (composed of HTML landing pages) and translated each example with an internal API. I then
                completed feature extraction and analysis of feature statistics in order to prep the training set for use with a
                multilingual model. </p>
            <p><strong>A Map-Building, Self-Driving, Voice-Controlled Service Robot (June 2016-May 2017)</strong></p>
            <p> Built and programmed autonomous robot with rich sensor suite and software stack in Python running on ROS.
                I also implemented capabilities to map an indoor environment and navigate to a destination on voice command, with
                the intention of helping those with impaired vision navigate their households and public spaces. Ultimately,
                the final prototype successfully aided a family member with poor vision around his home.</p>
