            <p> Hello, it's nice to meet you! I'm a rising junior majoring in CS and minoring in Sociology at Stanford. 
            I am currently spending my second summer working at Google as a STEP intern. </p>
            
            <p> Within my major, I specialize in Artificial Intelligence, and have extensive experience building and training models
            on big data. My most recent projects include a human-like chatbot that could make movie recommendations to a user based on past films
            they enjoyed, and a one-versus-the-rest multiclass algorithm that incorporated 
            BERT pre-classification to identify and flag social media accounts that were espousing hate speech alluding to in-person violence, such as mass shootings.</p>   

            <p> My minor program is officially named Poverty, Inequality, and Policy; its coursework focuses on using data science and 
            legislation to solve systemic socioeconomic problems in America. While I aim to have fluency and confidence in my Computer
            Science coursework, I also want to ensure that I use my computational skills to benefit humanity and work on issues like those presented
            in my minor. </p>
        
            <p> I have experience coding in Java, C++, C, R, Python, SQL, CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I'm comfortable working on front-end or back-end projects,
            and have taken classes on algorithms, computer systems, machine learning, and NLP. If you have a project that you think I may be
            interested in, please reach out! </p>
