      <h4> Computer Science @ Stanford University </h4>
      
      <p> Hello, it's nice to meet you! I'm a rising junior majoring in CS and minoring in Sociology at Stanford. 
          I am currently spending my second summer working at Google as a STEP intern. </p>
          
      <p> Within my major, I specialize in Artificial Intelligence, and have extensive experience building and training models
          on big data. My most recent projects include a human-like chatbot that could make movie recommendations to a user based on past films
          they enjoyed, and a one-versus-the-rest multiclass algorithm that incorporated 
          BERT pre-classification to identify and flag social media accounts that were espousing hate speech alluding to in-person violence, such as mass shootings.</p>   

      <p> My minor program is officially named Poverty, Inequality, and Policy; its coursework focuses on using data science and 
          legislation to solve systemic socioeconomic problems in America. While I aim to have fluency and confidence in my Computer
          Science abilities, I want to ensure that I use my computational skills to benefit humanity and work on issues like those presented
          in my minor. </p>
      
      <p> I have experience coding in Java, C++, C, R, Python, SQL, CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I'm comfortable working on front-end or back-end projects,
          and have completed extensive coursework in algorithms, computer systems, machine learning, and NLP. If you have a project that you think I may be
          interested in, please reach out! </p>
