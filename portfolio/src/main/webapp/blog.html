            <h2> Hello and welcome to my blog! </h2>
            <p> <strong> Blog Post #1 (6/23/20) </strong> </p>
            <p> Hello world! I have just begun this website as part of my initial work as a STEP intern
                at Google. I'm excited to slowly implemented more features and learn more about web development
                and backend servers, as I have had no coursework on the former and only class that reviews the latter.
                I hope that I gain powerful tools to design an effective and clever final with my two podmates.</p>
            <p> If you are an employee/intern at Google, you can check out my weekly progress and code changes at 
                go/anooshree-snippets, where I have also laid out my goals, questions, and feedback! This is my second 
                summer at Google, and I'm excited about working here again now that I have more familiarity with how a
                technical internship works and know how to use many of the internal resources. I'm hoping to fully
                take advantage of networking and career opportunities here despite the remote format, so if you are interested
                in chatting, please contact me at my work address! Similarly, if you know of any software resources that 
                I could use to advance my abilities and understanding, please get in touch. </p>
             <p> I plan to spend this summer doing a lot of learning and a lot of coding! In my free time, I will be
                out in nature as much as possible, as well as prepping for the upcoming school year and next summer. I'm 
                excited to learn more about SWE and APM roles at Google, as I love working here and would love to continue to
                do so as I make my way down my career path. Because I specialize in Artificial Intelligence within my major,
                I would also love to hear about any projects incorporating those techniques, whether it is for common good
                during these unprecendented times or part of your job. Thanks for reading! </p>
